  <title>Vue.js Local Storage</title>

  <!-- to get started with Vue all you need is to load the script -->
  <!-- this source is being loaded through a cdn which is faster and safer than the development version, but you could also load it locally -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app">
    My name is <input v-model="name">
  </div>

<!-- here's an example of how local storage works in action -->
<script>
    <!-- simply initate your Vue like normal -->
    const app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
      <!-- initiate the data set and variable with an empty value to show up on display and store into -->
      name: ''
    },
    <!-- setup Vue to load in the local storage value -->
    mounted() {
      if (localStorage.name) {
        this.name = localStorage.name;
      }
    },
    <!-- and then have Vue change the value within local storage whenever it changes -->
    watch: {
      name(newName) {
        localStorage.name = newName;
      }
    }
  });
