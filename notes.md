# Vue.JS Notes

## Why use Vue?

Vue is an easy system to render data dynamically within webpages and applications.

It allows you to render objects on the page using the most common form of data objects used in web applications, JSON.

Vue is a front-end javascript framework that solves a number of problems for people who are looking to get started with development.

It's easier to get started with then React. Is visually easier to read and works more simlarly to how you might expect if you're relatively new to software development.

You might be asking yourself what's the drawback of using Vue then?

If this framework is easier to develop with, certainly it has some major catches right??

Well, actually no. The drawbacks that Vue offers developers are relatively minor. While Vue isn't the fastest framework in terms of raw performance, it's by no means slow and its sheer popularity ensures that the framework's support into the future is all but guaranteed.
